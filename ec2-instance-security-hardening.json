  "description": "This project involved securing an Ubuntu-based EC2 instance by applying multiple layers of security best practices. Key-based SSH access was configured, system updates were applied, and automatic security upgrades enabled. UFW firewall was set up to restrict access, root login and password-based authentication were disabled, and Fail2Ban was configured to detect and block brute-force login attempts.",
